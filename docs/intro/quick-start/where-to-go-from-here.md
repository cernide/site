## Additional guides

In this introductory quick-start guides we learned what a Polyaxonfile is and how to execute it using the CLI.

The intro section provides several more guides and tutorials that answer common questions and scenarios that users face when using Polyaxon.

 * We recommend that users should check the other guides in this section to get to know other concepts, recurrent use-cases, and best practices for working with Polyaxon and for taking advantage of their Kubernetes cluster(s).
 * For in-depth documentation on using specific interfaces or tools, we suggest looking at the [references page](/docs/references/).
 * To learn more about how you can customize your deployment or how you can connect Polyaxon to external systems, you can find more information in the [setup section](/docs/setup/). 
 * Some other guides are published in other sections, for example:
   * [the scheduling strategies](/docs/core/scheduling-strategies/).
   * [the deployment strategies](/docs/setup/deployment-strategies/).

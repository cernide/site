Every organization comes with a default agent.

## Create agents

Once you create an agent, you can proceed to deploy it, please check the [agent setup](/docs/setup/agent/)

## Manage agents

You can list, review, and manage all your agents

![agent-manage](../../../../content/images/dashboard/agents/manage.png)

## Agent settings

You can update or delete an agent

![agent-settings](../../../../content/images/dashboard/agents/settings.png)

## Agent deployment

You can deploy an agent or refresh/regenerate its token using the configure tab

![agent-deployment](../../../../content/images/dashboard/agents/deployment.png)

## Agent connections

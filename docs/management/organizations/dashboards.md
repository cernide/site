Dashboards let you create visualizations, render assets, and widgets to analyze a run or a selection of runs.

Oftentimes, a dashboard might be generic and useful to save and reuse for future runs.
Polyaxon lets you save and describe dashboards and share them with the rest of your teams.


## Create dashboards

Saved dashboards are created on the project level, only users having write access to the project can create a dashboard,
and they can be used by any user who has read access to the project.

Users with the admin roles or higher can add new tags and assign them custom colors, they can also discover the tags that are used organization-wide.
Registering tags allows you to organize queues, presets, projects, runs, dashboards and searches.

One of the important features of adding canonical tags is that they are pre-loaded in all filters (runs, projects, components, models, â€¦), 
which would simplify showing/hiding information, additionally every time the tag is used it will be shown with the color associated to it.

## Tag creation

## Tag info

Each tag has an info button:

Users can check all entities that are tagged with a specific value:

![tag-entities](../../../../content/images/dashboard/tags/entities.png)

## Tag deletion

Admins can delete a tag and also untag all entities that have that value at the same time:

## Overview

A `Project` in Polyaxon is very similar to a project in GitHub,
it aims at organizing your efforts to solve a specific problem.

Polyaxon UI provides tools to:

 * Manage project default settings.
 * Restrict users and teams that can view and collaborate on projects.
 * Persist dashboards and searches for collaboration.
 * Drive analytics and view history of activities in each project.

## Tools

Similar to organizations, projects manage their own scoped [searches](/docs/management/organizations/searches/) and [dashboards](/docs/management/organizations/dashboards/), 
users can promote them to the organization level.
They also provide scoped views for [analytics](/docs/management/organizations/analytics/) and [activities](/docs/management/organizations/activities/).

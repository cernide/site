## Overview

The comparison view is a powerful tool for listing, filtering, sorting, rearranging, and comparing runs.


## Features

You can control the columns to show or hide on the table, you can control their order, and the width of each column:

You can filter and sort by many columns:

For runs with metrics, you can switch to a visualization mode to compare metrics charts, curve charts:

![comparison-bars](../../../../content/images/dashboard/comparison/charts-bars.png)

The comparison features are also useful to create charts for hyperparameter tuning or a selection of runs to create hyperparameter values and model metrics charts

And compare runs on Tensorboard

Good news! Polyaxon is based on a free & open source core engine.

You can self host it on your own cluster or local machine to have full control over your environment, and try all the core features.

If you're looking for some specific help, we've got an entire [documentation](https://polyaxon.com/docs/) site full of guides, specifications, references, and information.

Also, you can always get help on the [community channel](https://polyaxon.com/slack/) if you need a hand with anything else!

Finally, all plans come with a risk-free 14-days trial period. No credit card required.

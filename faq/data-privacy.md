No. We do not access, copy, or upload any of your train/test/dev data or models.

If you are using the community version (Polyaxon CE) or the on-premise enterprise version (Polyaxon EE), all your data, workload, models, logs, and metadata generated from your experiments stay within your secure cluster.

If you are using Polyaxon Cloud, all of your data, models, logs, code, and workload is managed by you on your own servers, we only manage the control plane.

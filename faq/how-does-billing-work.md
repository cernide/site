All Polyaxon distributions deploy your workload and manage your artifacts on your on-premise cluster or cloud provider.  

If you use a cloud provider, you will pay for all resources consumed using your account on that cloud provider.

For **Polyaxon Cloud** and **Polyaxon EE**, please check our pricing page for more details.

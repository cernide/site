Retention refers to the duration that we store some meta-data information in our system.

For projects and runs (including states, indexes, lineage meta-data, inputs and outputs meta-data), component hub and versions, model registry and versions, we offer unlimited rentention of those information.

We store the activity logs for a certain time (defined on your plan) and we purge that data periodically.

To store activities beyond your retention period, we offer an API that you can use to automatically archive it to an external source.

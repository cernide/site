**Seat** means each individual end-user.

A seat can be, including, without limitation, a person (team member, employee, external consultant, outsider, ...) or a machine (CI/CD tool, agent, workflow manager, ...) of the customer and/or its affiliates with access to Polyaxon.

A seat can be reassigned to a new user or a new machine, the history produced previously (runs, models, lineage, meta-data, activity logs, ...) does not get removed and can be searched even though the previous user(s) or machine(s) do not have access to the customer's organization anymore.

Each seat can create tokens that act on their behalf using our APIs or SDKs.

All your workload is scheduled on your own clusters whether you are using Polyaxon Cloud, Polyaxon EE, or Polyaxon CE.

Polyaxon can be setup on your own cloud subscription, on-premises hardware or a combination.

 * When you deploy Polyaxon EE or Polyaxon CE, you deploy and manage both the control plane and the data plane(workloads).
 * When you subscribe to Polyaxon Cloud and deploy Polyaxon Agent(s), you manage the data plane(workloads).

In both cases, you manage data plane(workloads) on your own resources and all of your data and executions stay in your environment and your control.

Polyaxon provides several [resources](/docs/resources/) and documentation about the roadmap, release notes,
guides on how to contribute to the platform development or security.

There's also a full list of all [references](/docs/references/) to learn about our APIs, clients, and language SDKs.

We manage most of the issues and feature requests on our [public Github repo](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon).

Polyaxon core engine is open-source, has a Json API, webhooks, and an abstraction for creating components, and can be integrated with just about any other app or service.

## Components

Polyaxon provides an interface for authoring reusable [components](/docs/core/specification/),
there's a growing ecosystem of components that can be used by other Polyaxon users, but it's a big world out there.
There are always useful integrations that don't yet exist, but should.
Users can contribute new components to the public [components registry](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-hub/)
or create private components for their own internal use.

## Integrations with the API/SDKs

Polyaxon provides a [Json API](/docs/api/) and a set of language [SDKs](/docs/references/#client-libraries)
that users can leverage for integrating Polyaxon with other systems or automation tools.

## API+Webhooks integrations

Polyaxon also supports custom API integrations which can be authenticated with individual keys,
and deliver outgoing [webhooks](/docs/references/polyaxon-webhooks/) based on particular events.

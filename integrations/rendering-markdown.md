Polyaxon UI comes with an auto-renderer for files ending with the `.md` extension.

## Go to the artifacts tab

The Artifacts tab allows users to organize files, events, logs, models, outputs, ... from their runs 
that can be natively rendered in Polyaxon UI! 

If your job or experiment generate or has a Markdown files that have been tracked by Polyaxon, you can navigate to the artifacts tab:

## Visualize the Markdown file

If you click on a file with an `.md` extension, Polyaxon will render it automatically:

![rendering-markdown](../../content/images/rendering/markdown.png)

## View raw content

You can also view the raw content which is rendered in a text editor:

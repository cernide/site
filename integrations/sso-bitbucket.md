You can use Bitbucket to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a Bitbucket application

You need to register a [new application](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html) on Bitbucket.

You should provide a callback URL: `[Domain/IP]/sso/bitbucket`

## Update your deployment config file

Use your client id and secret token to update your deployment config file.

```yaml
externalServices:
    auth:
      bitbucket:
        enabled: true
        options: {client_id: "#####", client_secret: "#####"}
```

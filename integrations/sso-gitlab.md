You can use GitLab to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a GitLab application

You need to register a [new application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/oauth_provider.html) on GitLab.

![gitlab-integration1](../../content/images/integrations/sso/gitlab.png)

You should provide a callback URL: `[Domain/IP]/sso/gitlab`

## Update your deployment config file

Use your client id and secret token to update your deployment config file.

```yaml
externalServices:
    auth:
      gitlab:
        enabled: true
        options: {client_id: "#####", client_secret: "#####"}
```

If you have an on-premise Gitlab installation you can additionally provide your Gitlab url:

```yaml
externalServices:
    auth:
      gitlab:
        enabled: true
        options: {client_id: "#####", client_secret: "#####", url: "privateUrl"}
```

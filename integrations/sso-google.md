You can use Google to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a Google application

You need to set up [OAuth application](https://console.developers.google.com/) via Google Developers Console.

You should provide a callback URL: `[Domain/IP]/sso/google`

## Update your deployment config file

Use your client id and secret token to update your deployment config file.

```yaml
externalServices:
    auth:
      google:
        enabled: true
        options: {client_id: "#####", client_secret: "#####"}
```

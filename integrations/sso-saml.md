You can use SAML to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Overview

Polyaxon supports using SAML authentication for Single Sign On, both when self-hosting and soon on the Polyaxon Cloud.

## Configure a SAML provider

Polyaxon works with various common SAML Identity Providers: [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/overview/) and [OneLogin](https://support.onelogin.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005181586-Configuring-SAML-for-Sentry).

You should provide a callback URL: `[Domain/IP]/sso/saml`

## Update your deployment config file

Use your information to update your deployment config file.

```yaml
externalServices:
    auth:
      saml:
        enabled: true
        options: {...}
```
